In-place Sorting algorithms  { O(1) without memory complexity }

~ Sort in place means that the sort changes the order of the elements in the original array
without exceeding the array for temporary storage of values. Thus, when sorting in place, 
the original array significantly influences the sorting process, and no additional memory
is required to store temporary values.


Stable Sorting algorithms

~ A stable sort, on the other hand, is a guarantee that elements with values ​​have 
ordered orderings in the same order they appear in the original array. A stable sort preserves 
their relative order in the sort result.
